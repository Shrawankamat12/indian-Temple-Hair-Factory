            <p>Indian Temple Remy Hair Exports was founded in 2014 out of a simple frustration: too much of the "Indian hair" sold worldwide passed through layers of resellers before it ever reached a real customer.</p>
            <p>We set out to manufacture, sort and export hair directly from our own factory floor in Najafgarh Road, New Delhi — keeping every stage of production, from sourcing to packing, under one roof and one standard of quality.</p>
            <p>Today, a team of 200+ artisans hand-sorts, double-draws and wefts every bundle that leaves our facility, shipping to distributors, salons and stylists in more than 50 countries.</p>
